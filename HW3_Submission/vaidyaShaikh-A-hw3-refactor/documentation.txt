How I Implemented TypeScript

I converted all of my JavaScript files into TypeScript by renaming them from .js to .ts and adding type annotations. I removed all the file extensions from the import statements so TypeScript and webpack could work correctly. I also created a tsconfig.json file to tell TypeScript how to compile everything in the src folder. Finally, I used webpack and ts-loader to bundle all the TypeScript files into one bundle.js file that the browser loads.

Challenges I Encountered

One challenge was that the browser could not load .ts files directly, which caused MIME and 404 errors until the bundling was set up correctly. I also ran into TypeScript errors when working with DOM elements, because TypeScript needs exact types like HTMLInputElement or HTMLButtonElement. Some audio variables were typed as possibly null, so I had to add null checks. Setting up webpack and understanding how everything connected together also took some time to get right.

Improvements and Optimizations

Adding TypeScript helped me catch several bugs early, especially with event targets and values coming from sliders. I created interfaces for objects like DrawParams to make the code easier to understand and more organized. I cleaned up old code, removed unused features like webkitAudioContext, and made sure every module exported and imported cleanly. Bundling everything into bundle.js made the final project simpler and easier for the browser to load.
