Audio Visualizer Project Documentation

Name: Aazeem Vaidya Shaikh
Project Title: Blue Nebula Visualizer

II. Audio Effect Nodes
I added two BiquadFilterNodes:

Bass Filter (Low-Shelf) – boosts or cuts low frequencies, which is controlled by the bass slider.

Treble Filter (High-Shelf) – boosts or cuts high frequencies, which is controlled by the treble slider.

III. Sprite Class

Class Name: Sprite
Small glowing circles that react to the music:

Size grows with bass

Color shifts with treble

Switches between filled/outlined on beats

Moves slowly across the screen and wraps around edges

They add energy and depth to the visualization.

IV. App Data (av-data.json)

The JSON file includes:

Title: Blue Nebula Visualizer

Track list (3 songs with file names/titles)

Starting settings

Instructions: “Press Play, toggle effects, adjust volume, switch tracks.”

The JSON initializes the app title, UI state, and track menu.

V. Aesthetic Improvements

Added animated blue gradient background (The nebula effect)

Neon-style glowing bars and rings

Beat-reactive sprites

Clean, organized control layout

Self-Grade: 15 / 15: I feel like I've added significant usability and aesthetic upgrades to the base project, and I would be proud to put this on my portfolio.
